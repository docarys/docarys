# docarys

[docarys](http://www.docarys.io) is yet a static site generator. Simple. Flexible. Customizable. Period. 

docarys is as magic as a dragon spitting fire 🐉 🔥

[![Material for docarys](docs/material.png)](https://github.com/docarys/docarys-material)

Based in concepts from mkdocs, hard-forked from mkdocs-material, inspired by Microsoft Docs, and built on top of Node.JS.

## Quick start

Install with `npm`:

``` sh
npm install -g docarys docarys-material generator-docarys
```

To create a new project:
``` sh
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
yo docarys
... (Follow the setup)
docarys serve
```

More details coming soon.
